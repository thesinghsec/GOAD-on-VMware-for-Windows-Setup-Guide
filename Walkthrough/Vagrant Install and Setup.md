ðŸ’¡ This guide outlines the process of setting up a GOAD (Game Of Active Directory) lab environment on a Windows host using VMware. It includes troubleshooting steps for common errors encountered during setup and how to resolve them.

While the GOAD Active Directory lab is typically installed from a Linux host as stated on the GitHub pages, it is still feasible to set it up from a Windows host. This guide outlines the process of achieving this setup efficiently without resorting to nested virtualization, which could significantly impact performance.

## Plan:

**Windows host:** with Vagrant installed to run the VMs on VMware.
**VMware Pro:** with Kali VM installed to run ansible playbooks to make the AD vulnerable.
[GOAD](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD/blob/main/ad/GOAD/README.md) : 5 VMs, 2 forests, 3 domains (full goad lab)

## Requirements:

### Download Vagrant:
